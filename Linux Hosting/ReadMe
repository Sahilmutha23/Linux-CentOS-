Hosted a Website on Linux!

I recently set up a web server on Linux, configuring firewall settings, hosting services, and security rules to ensure smooth and secure operations. Here’s a quick overview of what I worked on:

🔹 Configured Firewalld: Set up rules to allow essential services like HTTP (port 80), SSH, and HTTPS for secure access.
🔹 Verified Firewall Status: Ensured firewalld was active and running without issues.
🔹 Hosting Setup: Deployed a website using Apache/Nginx, configured virtual hosts, and managed hosting services.
🔹 Tested Hosting on Firefox: Successfully accessed the hosted website, ensuring proper DNS resolution and firewall allowances.

This was a great hands-on experience with Linux server administration, firewall security, and web hosting! Excited to explore more advanced configurations and optimizations.
