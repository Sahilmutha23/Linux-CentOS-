# 🐧 Linux Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Linux Projects Repository**, where I showcase my experience with system administration, server automation, hosting, and secure remote access using Linux (primarily CentOS-based environments). These projects reflect my hands-on approach to managing infrastructure through scripting, automation, and command-line expertise.
