Mar 2025 - Mar 2025Mar 2025 - Mar 2025
I worked on configuring SSH (Secure Shell) access in CentOS 9 to establish secure remote access between two systems. The project involved user management, remote file creation, SSH configuration tuning, and connection verification using a single gateway IP.

Key Features & Steps:
✅ Creating & managing user access across systems using IP's👨‍💻
✅ Establishing a connection using a single gateway IP 🌐
✅ Checking and verifying SSH service status to ensure smooth functionality📊
✅ Editing & fine-tuning SSH configuration files ⚙️
✅ Configuring SSH for secure remote access 🔗
✅ Verifying remote access by creating & managing files 📂

This project helped me strengthen my Linux administration and network security skills by implementing a real-time SSH configuration.
